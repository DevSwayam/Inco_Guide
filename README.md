# Inco Guide: Deploying Smart Contracts with Remix on Inco Network

## Wallet Setup

To interact with the Inco Network, you'll need a wallet. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Install [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download/) on your browser.
2. After installation, set up the Inco Devnet in Metamask by following [Inco's guide](https://docs.inco.network/getting-started/connect-metamask).

## Test Tokens

To perform transactions and deploy smart contracts, you need test tokens. Get them by following the steps in the [Inco Faucet guide](https://docs.inco.network/getting-started/faucet).

## Performing Transactions

1. Open Metamask and navigate to the wallet interface.
